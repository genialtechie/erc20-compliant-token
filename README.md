# erc20-compliant-token
This is an erc 20 compliant token I designed using solidity and truffle.
It also includes a token crowdsale contract I designed for a public sale of the token. 

# Usage
* You need to have Truffle, Ganache & Visual Studio installed.
* Clone the repository.
* In the node console, run `npm install` to install devDependencies. 
* Run `truffle migrate`, then `truffle test`.
